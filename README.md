I used reinforcement learning to train a quadcopter to take off and fly by maximizing the rewards using Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients (DDPG).

## Environment and tools

1. Jupyter Notebook
2. Numpy
3. Pandas
4. matplotlib

## Results

![Rewards](images/rewards.png)

## To Execute

`git clone https://github.com/abhinavsagar/DDPG-Quadcopter.git`

`cd DDPG-Quadcopter`

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

`jupyter notebook Quadcopter_Project.ipynb`
